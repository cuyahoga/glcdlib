This library lets an ATmega328 drive an ST7565-based GLCD display.

Derived from the JeeLabs GLCD_ST7565 library (https://github.com/jcw/glcdlib) which is targeted at their own Graphics Board and modified to work with a bare ST7565 board (as sold by Adafruit).

That in turn was derived from code in the ST7565 library by Adafruit (https://github.com/adafruit/ST7565-LCD)

Unpack the archive and rename the result to `GLCDlib`.  
Put it in the `libraries` folder in your Arduino sketches area.  
Restart the Arduino IDE to make sure it sees the new files.
